    "HABIBI_DESOLATOR_BODY_LORE" : "<i>In collaboration with [REDACTED], the Ministry of Information presents...</i>\n<i>DESOLATOR: REVOLUTIONARY HERO AGAINST TYRANNY!'</i>\n\nThe film sputters, its age showing like rust on metal, but it churns on tape nonetheless. It's played for a ragged bunker in which the blast-door is welded shut and lined to the edge with every available object in the room; books, chairs, the bed. Alone sits a jittery man, watching.\n\n<i>DESOLATOR, once a poor innocent boy from the slums who grew up with nothing but HATE from the tyrannical government! Sought a way to free himself and his comrades from the barbarians!\nHe himself organized our GLORIOUS REVOLUTION! Fighting side by side with the men on the frontlines to ensure that no battle was lost!\nBut eventually, he was GREIVOUSLY WOUNDED and using the power of experimental technology stolen from our OPPRESSORS, he was REBUILT into the hero we know him today!</i>\n\nThe bunker trembles, as its only illumination swings back and forth in response. His past had caught up to him, whose work would come haunt him.\nNone know the truth of his actions; his job was to cover it up after all. But such a job required such mental tenacity to endure painting over the facts.\nScreams could be heard outside the bunker, only to be drowned into what sounded like sludge.\n\n<i>DESOLATOR returned to the front of battle! rescuing all his fellow compatriots-</i>\n"They were massacred."\n<i>lest they bear the same burden as him!-</i>\n"You bared our brothers in arms as much suffering as you did to the enemy."\n<i>DESOLATOR AND HIS COMRADE'S REVOLUTION SAVED OUR PLANET, IN WHICH HE BUILT THE SOCIETY WE HAVE TODAY!</i>\n"All you left was a red river of bodies for a cause you didn't believe, the saviour of the revolution had the perfect excuse."\n\nBut before he could continue watching the tape, the frantic man felt his skin crawl, and sweat build. He was here.\nBefore another thought can be processed, the door glows an iridescent green and begins to melt. Bolts that held the door shut, that could withstand nuclear fallout, melted like butter against a hot knife. The remains of the barricade liquidated across the floor, lumps of metal and furniture; burning, melded into a radioactive soup. It's him, it's-\n\n<i>DESOLATOR!</i>\n\nThe film solemnly rings; before sputtering what's left of the record. Eventually dissolving like the door before it.\nBefore words could be exchanged, the dying man's melting flesh began to split and slip off his body, akin to slow cooked meat. His eyes became hazy, taking one last look at the radioactive presence as he spoke the last words the man would ever hear.\n\n"Shh, the end is near."\n\nBrain sloshing, muscle dripping to reveal the skeleton underneath, as even the atomic structure of bone started liquifying. Soon, the room itself was becoming unstable; the last things to leave were the heavy, steel-boot footsteps and heavy breathing. His respiration being the only thing human about him.",
